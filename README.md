# Bookshelf API Projects
This is my first project on API which is Bookshelf API. This API is built using NodeJS and uses a framework, namely the Hapi Framework. There are 5 main criteria, namely the first API can store books, the second is the API can display all books, then the third is the API can display book details, after that the fourth is the API can change book data, and the last is the fifth API. can delete books.
